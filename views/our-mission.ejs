      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        We are working towards reducing the drop out of students at different
        level. We are on a mission to provide upgraded information about
        education and encourage students to promote innovative based study
        instead of result-based study. The aim is to provide orientation to
        students in order to create a social equity with the cycle of rural
        education development. Through our platform, we aim to empower students
        to achieve their goals and reach their full potential ensuring sound
        mental health and wellbeing. Through slowly progressive counseling, the
        project stopped dozens of early marriages, convinced many parents to
        give equal meals & priority to the girls in the family, avoided multiple
        dropout cases and forced labor by teens, and incentivized parents to
        finance their children’s further educational costs. We welcome you to
        join us in our mission to support and uplift the next generation of
        leaders. After all, we believe in “Changing the society within the
        society.”
